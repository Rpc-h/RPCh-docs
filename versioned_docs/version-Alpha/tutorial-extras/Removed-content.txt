# Troubleshooting

The RPCh Alpha integration with BlockWallet has a few known bugs. They have been outlined below, along with troubleshooting tips to resolve the issue. If the known solutions do not work, try following the [additional steps outlined.](./troubleshooting.md#next-steps)

## BlockWallet Bugs

### Gas Estimation Error

**Known Issue:** Sometimes your wallet will display the “Gas estimation failed” error. As displayed in the image below.

**Solution:** The vast majority of the time, your transaction will still go through once you click `OK`.

</p>


### Missing Transactions

**Known Issue:** The activity tab might not display transactions right away.

**Solution:** Switch networks from `Gnosis on RPCh` to another network such as `Ethereum Mainnet`. And then switch networks back to `Gnosis on RPCh` to force the UI to update. 

Switching Networks:

### Network Provider Down

**Known Issue:** You may encounter a page with the error: `Network Provider Down`. This sometimes happens when you restart your browser or wallet.

**Solution:** Switch networks from `Gnosis on RPCh` to another network such as `Ethereum Mainnet`. And then switch networks back to `Gnosis on RPCh`.

### Transaction Stuck Processing

**Known Issue:** Confirmed transactions will sometimes get stuck as processing in the activity tab.

**Solution:** The UI should update on its own after a few seconds.

### Invalid Address 

**Known Issue:** Sometimes you get an image similar to the one below, where BlockWallet is stuck with an `Invalid Address` error. 

**Solution:** Restarting your wallet, but sometimes this may result in [transactions still not going through.](./troubleshooting.md#transactions-stuck)

</p>

### Transactions Stuck

**Known Issue:** Transactions can get stuck and stop going through giving you a BlockWallet error splash screen similar to the one below.

**Solution:** Try resetting your account, and if that does not work, re-installing your extension.

# Using BlockWallet

BlockWallet is the first wallet to partner with RPCh and integrate with RPCh Alpha! Downloading BlockWallet will give you complete privacy when making transactions on Gnosis. You can download BlockWallet from either the Chrome webstore or GitHub.

**Note:** This version of the integration only uses RPCh Alpha for Gnosis chain transactions. To use RPCh with a different wallet or chain, you can use our Docker connector to run RPCh locally. A guide for this can be found [here.](./Using-RPCh-with-your-own-wallet.md)

## Download from the Chrome Webstore

(**1**) Find the latest BlockWallet release on the Webstore or just click [here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockwallet-rpch-experime/fhjkaoanopnkfmlahebnoeghlacnimpj)

(**2**) Simply add the extension to your browser

(**3**) And set up the wallet as prompted

![Setup BlockWallet](/img/BlockWallet_start_up_3.png)

That's all! Make sure to use the network `Gnosis over RPCh` for complete privacy while using the Gnosis chain!

## Download from GitHub

Alternatively, you can download the RPCh integrated release from GitHub.

**Note:** The following instructions are for Chrome, but a similar set of instructions can be followed for any alternative browser.

(**1**) Locate the BlockWallet.zip file in the assets of this [GitHub page](https://github.com/Rpc-h/RPCh/releases/tag/v0.2.1), or click [here](./blockwallet-beta.zip) to download the folder.

![GitHub Assets](/img/GitHub_assets.png)

(**2**) Extract the folder.

(**3**) Go to your browser and open “Extensions”. 

(**4**) Toggle on Developer mode, and press the “load unpacked” button that appears on the top left.

![Extensions](/img/Extensions_chrome2.png)

(**5**) When prompted, select the folder you previously extracted.

(**6**) The BlockWallet setup page should appear.

![Setup BlockWallet](/img/BlockWallet_start_up_3.png)

That’s all! Just set up the wallet as prompted, and all your Gnosis chain transactions will be completely private! Make sure you use the Network `Gnosis on RPCh`.

Here's a short tutorial of the installation process:

    </video>
</p>

## Test that it works

Once you have added the new Network to your wallet you can test that it is actually working by inspecting your browser wallet. The instructions below show how to do this for Chrome.

(**1**) Go to your browser's extensions page. For chrome you can type the following URL into your search bar: `chrome://extensions/`

(**2**) Locate the hyperlinked text: `service worker`/`background page` at the bottom of your wallet extension. 

![Inspect](/img/Extensions_chrome_inspect.png)

(**3**) With the newly exposed console window open, connect to an exchange such as [SushiSwap](https://www.sushi.com/swap) and see exactly what your wallet is doing, including its interactions with RPCh/HOPR nodes.
